# youtube-autocloser
Youtube extension for Chrome and Firefox

This extension enables you to close the current playing Youtube tab at the end of the video :)

This leads to two awesome features:

## PlaylistTab feature:

You want to watch several videos but you can't watch them all at once? 
Open them in tabs (right click, new tab). 

At the end of a video, the extension will close the current video tab and skip to the next one!

## "Stop Procrastinate" feature 
( yes I'm good at naming things :P)
You wanted to watch only one video but you ended up chilling on Youtube for 2 hours? 

You can install this extension and stop losing your time.
